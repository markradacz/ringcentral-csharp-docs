# System Requirements


## Windows or Mac?

First things first. You should decide whether you want to use Windows or Mac to create apps.

### Mac Cons:

1. Cannot create apps for Windows

### Windows Cons:

1. Cannot create apps for Mac
1. If you need to create apps for iOS, you also need a Mac


## Xamarin Studio or Visual Studio?

Rule of thumb: Xamarin Studio for Mac and Visual Studio for Windows.

Visual Studio is not available on Mac, if you work on Mac, Xamarin Studio is the only choice.

Xamarin Studio is available on Windows but the Windows edition only supports Android. Visual Studio is a better choice if you work on Windows IMHO.


## Mac OS X Requirements
